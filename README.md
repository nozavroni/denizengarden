To anybody interested in seeing what I've done with ReactJS, I can't put it on GitHub because of licensing issues. But I have opened access to it here: https://bitbucket.org/lukevisinoni/denizen-garden/src/0ea21dac8f1fb1da94cf8a7c2cb0ab4c73e6e57d?at=master -- Just a note: This is my first time using webpack, reactjs, and most of the other technology it uses... and I put it together fairly quickly
